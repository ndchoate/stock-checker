# stock-checker

A simple Python script to check for stock on gym equipment that I wrote earlier in the pandemic.

The script checks for certain products every 10 minutes. If it finds certain items on the page that may indicate that the
item is in stock, it will send an SMS alert to my personal phone number using the Twilio Python package.
